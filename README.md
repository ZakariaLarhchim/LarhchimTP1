<p>spaCy is a free and open-source library for Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python with a lot of in-built capabilities. It‚Äôs becoming increasingly popular for processing and analyzing data in NLP. Unstructured textual data is produced at a large scale, and it‚Äôs important to process and derive insights from unstructured data. To do that, you need to represent the data in a format that can be understood by computers. NLP can help you do that.</p>

Natural language processing (NLP) is a field that focuses on making natural human language usable by computer programs. NLTK, or Natural Language Toolkit, is a Python package that you can use for NLP.

A lot of the data that you could be analyzing is unstructured data and contains human-readable text. Before you can analyze that data programmatically, you first need to preprocess it. In this tutorial, you‚Äôll take your first look at the kinds of text preprocessing tasks you can do with NLTK so that you‚Äôll be ready to apply them in future projects. You‚Äôll also see how to do some basic text analysis and create visualizations.

If you‚Äôre familiar with the basics of using Python and would like to get your feet wet with some NLP, then you‚Äôve come to the right place.

By the end of this tutorial, you‚Äôll know how to:

Find text to analyze
Preprocess your text for analysis
Analyze your text
Create visualizations based on your analysis

Hugging Face is an NLP-focused startup with a large open-source community, in particular around the Transformers library. ü§ó/Transformers is a python-based library that exposes an API to use many well-known transformer architectures, such as BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2 or DistilBERT, that obtain state-of-the-art results on a variety of NLP tasks like text classification, information extraction, question answering, and text generation. Those architectures come pre-trained with several sets of weights. Getting started with Transformers only requires to install the pip package:


pip install transformers

The library has seen super-fast growth in PyTorch and has recently been ported to TensorFlow 2.0, offering an API that now works with Keras‚Äô fit API, TensorFlow Extended, and TPUs üëè. This blog post is dedicated to the use of the Transformers library using TensorFlow: using the Keras API as well as the TensorFlow TPUStrategy to fine-tune a State-of-The-Art Transformer model.
